# The Last City

## Introduction
This game is the first project in the first module of Ironhacks Full Stack Developer Program.

The goal was to create a simple shooting game with a clear winning and losing setup.
An additional challenge was to animate the characters using sprite sheets

### Game Story

#### The Last Hope
The year is 2072 and the covid19 virus has been causing havac on the Earth for more than 5 decades.
Throughout the year the virus has mutated countless of times and more than 99% of earth population is currently infected with the virus… 
Only one city remains uninfected with the virus - “The Last Hope”.
You are one of the citizens in The Last Hope and you have been tasked to guard the northern gates for the day. Little do you know that a swarm of infected people are on their way to The Last City. If the gates are breached all hope for humanity is lost.
Be prepared for the longest day of your life
